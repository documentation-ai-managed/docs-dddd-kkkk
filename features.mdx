</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

</Callout>

## Organization and Folder Structures

You organize content into spaces, folders, and subfolders for clear navigation. This hierarchical structure scales for large projects.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Space: Project Docs] --> B[Folder: API Reference]
    A --> C[Folder: User Guides]
    B --> D[Getting Started.md]
    B --> E[Authentication.md]
    C --> F[Installation.md]
    C --> G[Troubleshooting.md]
```

Use drag-and-drop to reorder or nest folders. Link pages with `[internal links](/path/to/page)` for better connectivity.

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Invite team members to collaborate in real time. You control permissions per space or document.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Team Invite" icon="users">
    Go to space settings > `Members` > Add email.
    
    Roles: `Editor`, `Viewer`, `Admin`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Public Sharing" icon="share-2">

    Embed documents via `<iframe src="https://docs.example.com/embed/doc-id">`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    View changes, restore versions, or compare edits.
